# 🛳️ Task 02: Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is part of my data science internship, where I conducted **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the classic **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The Titanic dataset contains information on the passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. This analysis aims to explore the dataset, clean missing or inconsistent data, and uncover patterns that influenced survival.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Task_02_Titanic_EDA.ipynb` – The main Jupyter notebook with all steps
- `Task 2 Titanic Dataset EDA.pdf` – Summary report
- Charts & visualizations (embedded in the notebook)
- `README.md` – This file

## 📊 Key Steps Performed

- Handled missing values in columns like `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked`
- Converted categorical variables for analysis
- Visualized survival distribution across:
  - Gender
  - Passenger class
  - Age groups
  - Fare ranges
- Analyzed correlations and patterns using visualizations

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Females had higher survival rates** compared to males
- **1st class passengers** had better chances of survival
- **Younger passengers** were more likely to survive
- **Fare** also showed a positive correlation with survival
